## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber trip data to uncover trends in trip distances, timing, and categories.  
This project uses **statistics, probability, and feature engineering** to generate actionable insights for operations and business strategy.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
**Dataset:** `myuber.csv` â€“ Uber trip records  

**Key Features:**

| Column         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `TRIP_ID`      | Unique trip identifier |
| `START_DATE*`  | Trip start timestamp |
| `END_DATE*`    | Trip end timestamp |
| `CATEGORY*`    | Trip type (UberX, UberPool, etc.) |
| `MILES*`       | Distance of trip in miles |
| `PURPOSE*`     | Trip purpose |
| `CITY*`        | Trip city |

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Highlights
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.  
- **EDA:** Histograms, scatter plots, boxplots; outlier detection; peak hours analysis.  
- **Probability:** Likelihood of long-distance trips; peak time identification.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted Hour, Day, Month; aggregated metrics like total miles per category.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion & Insights

Trip Distance vs Time of Day â†’ Most trips are short (<10 miles); longer trips occur during off-peak hours.

Category Analysis â†’ UberX dominates the dataset; other categories like UberPool have lower frequency.

Peak Hour Analysis â†’ Early mornings and evenings have the highest number of trips, indicating demand patterns.

## âœ… Business Takeaways

Optimize Driver Allocation â†’ Focus on high-demand hours and areas to improve service efficiency.

Pricing Strategy â†’ Adjust pricing based on trip distance distribution and category usage.

Category-Based Insights â†’ Promote underutilized categories like UberPool to balance demand.
